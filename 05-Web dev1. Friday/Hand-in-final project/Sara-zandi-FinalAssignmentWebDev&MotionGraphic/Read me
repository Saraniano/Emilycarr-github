Hi again George,



This is whole website which I recommended to look at for my both Motion graphic and Web dev1 assignment.

This website has 2 pages
1- Homepage
2-blog

if you click on blog page on menu bar or in the home page, it will take you to blog page.

You can hover on all titles "h1","h2" have some animations.

My navigation bar has more section under photography page. Also I have a log in form under "my cart" section on menu bar.

My social media icons and navigation bar have fixed position and you can hover them as well.

here is the link to ftp server:

Cheers,
