Hi George,

This page is a sub page of my website which I'll present that tomorrow. if you remember we agreed to have a one website, which has enough animation and work to do.

I decided to present one sub page as my motion graphic assignment to have at least something for handing. But I recommend you see whole website together.

So. this is the blog page of pacificView's website.

Important note: I try to make this page(only blog page) responsive so you can see the mobile version of I by making browser smaller.

In my blog page, I have 19 elements which have animation.

I list them here to make your job easy to find,

As you are loading the page,
1- I have 3 column coming to the page.
1- All my titles have animation by hover.
2- I have one bird flying as page is loading.
3- I have 3 birds at the bottom of my page and if you click each of them, you can see the animation.
4- have 4 social media icons that move by hover.

cheers,
Sara
