</div><h2>One-Time Only</h2>
<h3>Setting up repository for the first time</h3>
<div class="codeblock">
<code>git clone --branch master http://git.drupal.org/project/simplepassage.git</code><br>
<code>cd simplepassage</code><br>
</div>
Not working for you? See <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1065850">Troubleshooting Git clone</a>. Once it works, you need the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/git_deploy">Git deploy</a> module. See <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1314752">Versioned dependencies and Git</a> for an explanation.
<h2>Routinely</h2>
The headings below are not sequential. What you choose to do depends on where you are in your process.
<h3>Checking your repository status</h3>
To see what you will commit by running <code>git commit</code> and what you could commit by running <code>git add</code> before running <code>git commit</code>.
<div class="codeblock">
<code>git status</code><br>
</div>
<h3>Switching to a different branch</h3>
When you clone the repository you have access to all the branches and 
tags. The first command shows your choices. The second command makes the
 switch. See <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1066342">branching and tagging</a> for details.
<div class="codeblock">
<code>git branch -a</code><br>
<code>git checkout [branchname]</code><br>
</div>
<h2>Patching</h2>
<h3>Getting ready to create or apply patches</h3>
If you have not already cloned the repository, follow the directions 
above for setting up this repository in your local environment. Be sure 
you are on the branch you wish to patch, then ensure it is up-to-date 
with the following command:
<div class="codeblock">
<code>git pull origin master</code><br>
</div>

<h3>Creating a patch</h3>
For most improvements, use the following command after making your changes:
<div class="codeblock">
<code>git diff &gt;  [description]-[issue-number]-[comment-number].patch</code> <br>
</div>
For more complex improvements that require adding/removing files, work 
over the course of multiple days including Git commits, or collaboration
 with others, see the <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1054616">Advanced patch workflow</a>.

<h3>Applying a patch </h3>
Download the patch to your working directory. Apply the patch with the following command:
<div class="codeblock">
<code>git apply -v [patchname.patch]</code><br>
</div>

To avoid accidentally including the patch file in future commits, remove it:
<div class="codeblock">
<code>rm  [patchname.patch]</code><br>
</div>

<h3>When you're done: Reverting uncommited changes</h3>
Revert changes to a specific file:
<div class="codeblock">
<code>git checkout [filename]</code><br>
</div>

Revert changes to the whole working tree:
<div class="codeblock">
<code>git reset --hard</code><br>
</div>  </div>
  </div>
</div>
